# Proposals

## PyData - NYC - 2015
### Reproducibility of your development environment
"Reproducible" is not a new word in science, but it can be a surprise for newcomers that they also need to have reproducible software environments. What was working yesterday may not work today, but there is a way to prevent that and that's what we are going to explore. We will take a sneak peek at different open source solutions to help maintain a reproducible, shareable environment. 

#### Abstract
* I will define a reproducible development environment while getting input from the audience. We will consider programming language, dependencies, services, database engines, and data while coming up with this definition.
* I will introduce open source solutions and best practices to specify environments. I will talk about conda, virtualenv, pyenv, etc. And I'll describe tools like docker or SaaS solutions to have reproducible environments.
* I will present tools to publish environments like Anaconda.org and Github.

## Nicar - 2015
### I have an idea, now what do I need to have my news app?
#### Proposed title
I have an idea, now what do I need to have my news app?
#### Session description
In a news room, how many times have we thought "this could be a really nice news app" or "there's gotta be a better way to show/explain this" or (why not?) "we can build something better". Many times we have something like an idea or at least, there is something in our head, that it's not clear, but it's something. Well, I want to talk about these moments when we have this idea and how can we extract it, solidify it and take to the process of actually building something with it.
I want to take some concepts from requirements engineering, product designing and software engineering, and apply them into the context of a news room.

#### Proposed speakers/moderators for this session?
Just me.

#### Who would be your target audience for this session?
News apps developers and reporters interested in news apps.

## MozFest - 2014
### PirateBox hands on v2.0
#### What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?
It will allow the people to familiarize with the project PirateBox. It
will allow people to actually play with one and discover how to hack
it and how to enjoy it.

#### How do you see that working?
No more that 15 minutes to describe the project. A little bit about
the spin off projects (LibraryBox and maybe something about the
OpenWireless Movement). And we will start hacking with some
pirateboxes I'll bring with two options: trying to accomplish some
configuration tasks or trying to innovate with new alternative uses of
the piratebox.

#### How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?
I'm thinking on splitting on groups no more that 4 people. And since
I'll bring my own devices, the limit will be given by the amount of
devices I'll be able to carry.

#### What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?
I hope to engage more people with the project, the let them
familiarized with the technology and maybe to come out with new
potencial uses.

### Process in a news room. How do you meet your deadlines?
#### What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?
This session is designed for journalists, designers or developers who
works in news room or people interested in learning about different
process while developing software.
In this session people will learn about traditional developing process
like Scrum, Kanban, Rup or Waterfall.
We will also learn and discuss how are newsrooms solving this problems
and how do they function in environments covered with breaking news
and hard limits.

#### How do you see that working?
I plan to invite people who works in different news rooms so people
can share their experiences, discuss problematics and compare
alternatives. We are also going to compare the main differences
between working in a news room and working on a traditional software
company.

#### How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?
If we have 5 participants we will discuss between us. If we have more
than eight we will split into groups and we will have a conclusion
plenary at the end.

#### What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?
I expect to write a blog post about different ways of handling
software process in news rooms. I also expect people to take the
discussion or debate to their own newsrooms so in case they need, they
can improve they way they are working. Or at least talk about it.

### Beyond scraping
#### What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?
I expect people to leave the room knowing how to scrape a website with
basic tools or, for the more advance participants, to know what do you
need to have in mind when scraping a website. What other steps you
need to do or what need of cautions you need to take.

#### How do you see that working?
We're planning on provide a short description / introduction and then
splitting the crowd in groups taking in consideration whether they
have past experienced with scraping or not. Then we will provide a set
of prefixed tasks to do on their computers. The tasks will be divided
on level of difficult. Lastly we will walk around the groups to help
them move across the steps.
To download any necessarily software we will use a PirateBox with the
most common libraries.

#### How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?
We will split into groups.

#### What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?
We hope to find gaps on the available tools whether they are for
hardcore users or for newcomers. And we expect from our assistants to
have a new lever of understanding of the problem.

## DataBootCamp - 2014 (Mex)
### Hands on Extracción de datos
Ejemplos de extracción y almacenamiento de datos desde distintas fuentes. (90min).

### Hands on Limpieza de datos
Actividades y ejemplos de limpieza de bases de datos. (90min).

## MediaParty - 2014
### The Texas Tribune, qué hacemos y cómo lo hacemos
En The Texas Tribune nos tomamos los temas referidos a datos de manera bastante seria, por eso, en esta charla les quiero contar cómo es el día a día del News App Team. Cómo involucramos a nuestros colegas periodistas y cuál es el proceso alrededor de cada app que publicamos. Un poquito acerca de las herramientas y servicios que usamos que usamos y algunos detalles sobre uno de nuestros últimos juguetes, The Texas Hospitals Explorer.

### PirateBox, hands on!

El PirateBox es un router modificado para compartir archivos de forma anónima y de manera local. Se pensó para compartir libremente archivos bajo licencias libres o de dominio público. Pero con algunos toques se lo puede convertir en una herramienta para prevenir censura o para generar conectividad en lugares con dificultades para acceder a Internet o como registro de datos en tiempo real. En este taller quiero presentar el proyecto y sus variantes. Compartir el proceso de armado de un PirateBox y discutir posibles usos y soluciones en el ámbito periodístico.

Cómo outcome, espero que los participantes se familiaricen con el proyecto y sepan los pasos para construir y configurar un PirateBox. También espero un debate y sus conclusiones acerca de cómo mover el proyecto hacia una herramienta útil para periodistas.

Para el taller voy a necesitar algunos routers y pendrives. Yo voy a llevar algunos, pero estaría buenísimo tener stock para que los grupos puedan trabajar más cómodos.

### Herramientas y herramientas para manejar datos desde la A hasta la Z
Descripción de tu propuesta de workshop: Haremos un viaje por la 'data pipeline', desde la obtención de datos, pasando por la extracción de los mismos, limpieza, análisis y finalmente presentación. La propuesta es que los participantes formen grupos de no más de 5 personas y en un taller vivencial utilicen, descubran y experimenten con las herramientas presentadas para manejar datos en cada etapa (también se aceptarán herramientas presentadas por el público). El tablero de herramientas propuestas surgió en un taller similar que dimos con Zara Rahman de Escuela de datos en OkFestival 2014. Outcome Aprender y experimentar con herramientas de manejo de datos. Reconocer las distintas etapas del data-pipeline. Requerimientos Proyector Habilidades o experiencia previa necesaria para participar del workshop Ninguno. Cada grupo va a usar computadoras para desarrollar su proceso de datos y aprender sobre las herramientas. Notas del taller de okfestival: https://pad.okfn.org/p/Tools_tools_and_more_tools Separamos en grupos y cada grupo inicia con unos datos que nosotros proveemos de manera ficticia y a lo receta de cocina en la TV invitamos a los participantes a seleccionar que herramientas usaron para las distintas etapas de su journey. Usamos el tablero para presentar herramientas y si salen nuevas, las agregamos Explico un poco más (y siendo prolijo).

### Your first News-App
The propose for this workshop is to create your first News App. And we are going to start from the very beginning. We are going to search for a dataset and we are going to play with it. We are going to clean it with Open-Refine. We are going to import it into a spreadsheet and we are going to publish it on the web. And this is all going to happen in an hour! I know it's a short time, but I think it's enough to understand the basis of the data-flow of a News App and the publication on the web.

### Tu primera News App
En este taller te propongo crear tu primer News App. Para esto, vamos a empezar por el principio. Vamos a buscar un set de datos y vamos a jugar un poco con el. Lo vamos a limpiar y a ordenar usando Open-Refine. Lo vamos a importar a una planilla de cálculos y lo vamos a visualizar en la web. Todo eso es una hora! Yo se que es poco tiempo, pero creo que es suficiente como para entender a grandes rasgos el flujo de una News App. Desde la idea, investigación hasta la ejecución y la publicación en la web.

## SRCCON - 2014
### Process in a News App Team
When building a traditional software product, all the discussions about the process behind it are mostly closed. There are plenty of solutions out there, no matter if you are into iterative or sequential design process or if you are a fan of the Agile movement. You will find a process that suits your team/product.

In the news room, things are not so easy. We have new actors and we lost some of the traditionals. Almost no news room has a project manager, but  we have editors and reporters. Most of the actors are assigned to more than a single project. The projects are also different, whether you have a new app coming on, you are maintaining an old one or you are just working on a chart that needs to be published today.

In this session I want to discuss processes in a News Room. How do we handle our process? How do we keep track of the progress? Is Scrum or Kanban good for us? What indicators are suitable for us?

Who is this session for? News application developers, Editors and PMs

## Data Gotham - datagotham.com - 2014
### How we craft data at the TexasTribune
The Texas Tribune is a nonprofit media organization in Texas. At the News App team, we work with data everyday. We work with many type of data from multiple sources. Sometimes a reporter comes with an idea, we search for the data, we clean the data, we play with it and we help the reporter to tell a story. Some other times we get a dataset and we build an app to help readers to have a better experience with it. We build explorers, visualizations or just simple tables. In this presentation I want to tell you what is our data workflow, from getting the data to publishing it on our website. What happens in the middle, what tools do we use, who are the people involve, how much fun do we have with it.

## CSVconf, csvconf.com
###From CSV to publish
In this workshop we are going to work with a dataset, we are going to clean and adjust it, we are going to publish it and finally we are going to publish. This is a newbies oriented workshop to show and demonstrate what are the basic steps when working with data. What are the most common tools, storage alternatives, best practices and some simple concepts about publishing on the web.

### Talking about scraping
Sometimes the only way to get some data is to manually get it from the web or an API. This can be an easy task as “copy and paste” and some other a complex and long process. The intend of this talk is to summarize recommendations and suggestions when scraping one or multiple websites. I’m going to talk about pre cooked solutions, storage options, cache and I’ll show some useful tools.
